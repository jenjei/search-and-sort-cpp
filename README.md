# Test bed for search and / or sorting algorithms

This is the final project of the school course called "Data Structures and Algorithms".

## How to compile

Clone this project to your local environment.

``` g++ *.cpp ``` :arrow_right: ```./a.out ```

## Tasks

- [x] 1 point: The program makes a sequential_search from the data given to it based on some key value. Result of the search is output to the screen. Performance data is output to the screen from sequential search as well.
- [ ] 2 points: The program makes a binary_search from the data given to it based on some key value. Any binary_search variant handled in the lessons can be used. Result of the search is output to the screen. After the search some performance data is output also to the screen.
- [ ] 3 points: The program makes insertion sort to the randomized data.
- [ ] 4 points: The program makes sorting of performance n*log⁡( n ) to the randomized data. Merge sort and quicksort are this kind of algorithms; you just pick one candidate. 
- [ ] 5 points: Add to your program one sorting algorithm of class n^2 and one sorting algorithm of class n*log⁡( n ) (performance) not added before. In addition to output sorting results also a comparison must be output of performance of all used sorting algorithms.
